# canopy.rs

**High-performance linguistic analysis Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation in Rust**

canopy.rs is a complete redesign of spaCy-LSP, transforming from Python's surface-level semantic mapping to a theoretically-grounded linguistic analysis platform. Built with Rust for 10x performance improvements while maintaining rich semantic analysis capabilities.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- **10x Performance**: Sub-50ms LSP responses vs 200ms Python baseline
- **Theoretical Foundation**: Formal linguistic theory (DRT, Optimality Theory, movement chains)
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time guarantees for linguistic constraints
- **Production Ready**: Zero-copy parsing, bounded memory usage, comprehensive testing

## 🏗️ Architecture

### 4-Layer Design

```
Text → Layer 1: Morphosyntax → Layer 2: Events → Layer 3: DRT → Layer 4: Discourse/LSP
         ↓                         ↓                  ↓              ↓
    [UDPipe + Features]    [Multi-dominance + OT]  [λ + DRS]   [Context + Diagnostics]
```

### Core Transformation

- **V1 Python**: `spaCy → JSON → Proto → LSP`
- **V2 Rust**: `UDPipe → Events → DRT → LSP` with typed, theory-driven representations

- **Golden Tests**: Deterministic output validation with `insta` snapshots
- **Benchmarks**: Performance regression detection with `criterion`
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end LSP scenarios
- **Security Tests**: Dependency scanning and vulnerability checks

### Testing Philosophy

- **Fast Feedback**: `cargo nextest` for 3x faster test execution
- **High Coverage**: 95%+ line coverage with `cargo-tarpaulin`
- **Linguistic Correctness**: Property-based tests for theoretical constraints
- **Performance**: Continuous benchmark monitoring with statistical rigor
