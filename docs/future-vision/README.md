# Canopy Future Vision: Neurosymbolic AI Platform

## Overview

This directory contains the comprehensive enhancement strategy for transforming canopy.rs from a high-performance linguistic analyzer into the foundational platform for next-generation neurosymbolic AI.

## Current Status (M3 Baseline)

**Performance Excellence Achieved:**
- 🚀 **33-40μs semantic analysis** (12-15x better than 500μs target)
- 🎯 **100% F1 score** theta role accuracy
- 📊 **99.7% VerbNet** XML parsing success rate (332/333 files)
- 📈 **69.46% test coverage** (gate: 69%, target: 80% for M3, 90% for M4)

## Vision: Revolutionary Neurosymbolic Integration

**Goal**: Achieve sub-microsecond semantic analysis through GPU acceleration, enabling real-time linguistic enhancement of neural language model training—potentially solving fundamental compositionality problems in AI.

**Core Breakthrough**: Replace frequency-based tokenizers (BPE, WordPiece) with linguistically-informed tokenization that's actually **faster** (0.5μs) while providing rich semantic information.

### M5: Advanced Reasoning & GPU Acceleration
**Target**: <1.5μs per sentence in large batches
- Modal Logic & Possible Worlds
- Enhanced Temporal Logic
- GPU Database (RAPIDS → Custom kernels)

### M6: Neurosymbolic AI Revolution
**Target**: Process 100M sentences in <2 hours, enable real-time ML training
- Linguistic Tokenization (faster than traditional while semantically rich)
- Transformer Enhancement (structured attention)
- Training Pipeline Integration (constraint-based losses)

## Key Design Principles

1. **Backward Compatibility**: All enhancements are additive
2. **Performance First**: Never degrade existing 33-40μs baseline
3. **Theory-Driven**: Every feature grounded in formal linguistics
4. **Type Safety**: Leverage Rust's type system for linguistic constraints
5. **Incremental Complexity**: Build on solid M3 foundation

## Performance Targets

| Component | Single Item | Small Batch (10) | Large Batch (1000) | XLA Optimized |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| **Total Enhanced** | <120μs | <50μs/item | <1.5μs/item | **<1.0μs/item** |
| **Core Analysis** | 33-40μs | 15μs/item | 0.15μs/item | 0.10μs/item |
| **VerbNet Lookup** | 5-10μs | 2-5μs/item | 0.05-0.1μs/item | 0.03-0.08μs/item |
| **Construction Detection** | 10-20μs | 5-10μs/item | 0.1-0.5μs/item | 0.08-0.4μs/item |

## Research Impact

1. **Computational Linguistics**: First production system combining formal theory with sub-microsecond performance
2. **Machine Learning**: Revolutionary linguistic tokenization potentially solving compositionality problems
3. **Neurosymbolic AI**: Bridge between symbolic reasoning and neural architectures via real-time integration
4. **Industry Applications**: Real-time semantic analysis for next-generation language technologies

## Getting Started

1. **Read Current Architecture**: Start with [`current-architecture/`](current-architecture/) to understand our solid foundation
